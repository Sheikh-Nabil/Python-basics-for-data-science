# Week1 Evaluation caB #
##Learning the sexiest job in the market with [CA Berlin](https://www.codeacademyberlin.com/)## 

---
**Chapter 1 :**

This chapter I learned about the basics of [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) why it is impotant for [data science](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Science) and how the basics works. Python is basically a [High Level Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language). 


The second part I got introduced with [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) and how it reacts with [Git Hub](https://github.com/CodeAcademyBerlin/content). And for the last part I started working with the famously used [calendly](https://calendly.com/jost_cab/meetin) for Code Academy Berlin.

**Chapter 2 :**
This chapter of the week I actually started coding with python but before we learned how to put all of our team workflow in the same line by using [Trello](https://trello.com/en). 

[Data Types](https://dsft.code-data-ai.com/data-types-python/)- Basically in this segment I learned about different types of data types and operators in python.

**Chapter 3 :**

This chapter is segmented in three parts- 

|Seg1|Seg2|Seg3|
|---|---|---|
|Decision Making|Working with loops|Assignments

A little hints below - 

**Seg 1:_**
[Decision Making](https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/decision-making-in-python/)**:**

There comes a point in our life where we need to decide what steps should be taken and based on that we decide our next decisions. In programming, we often have this similar situation where we need to decide which block of code should be executed based on a condition.Decisions like these are required everywhere in programming and they decide the direction of flow of program execution. Python has the following decision-making statements:

1. if statement
2. else statement 
3. if-elif ladder
4. Nested Statements

**Seg 2:_**
[Working with loops](https://www.openbookproject.net/books/bpp4awd/ch04.html)**:**


Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating identical or similar tasks without making errors is something that computers do well and people do poorly.

Repeated execution of a set of statements is called iteration. Python has two statements for iteration â€“ the [for](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp) statement, which we met last chapter, and the [while](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp) statement.


**Seg 3 :**
[Assignments](https://dsft.code-data-ai.com/python-workshops/) :** 

First 15 problems were solved in this segments. By doing so we learned mostly about functions and how it workes for different values.

**Chapter 4 :**

This chapter we made the evalution of our 15 problems from the assignments. 

We wrote [Scripts](https://linuxhint.com/python_scripts_beginners_guide/) of python for the first time.

This part was really fun, we coded a guessing game where a user has to guess a number and get the result in three chances where the right number will be random every time.
